# Bootbox

## What is Bootbox?
In short: Bootbox is a collection of mods, components, sections and pages for
use with the [Bootstrap](https://www.getbootstrap.com) framework. **It isn't a
theme**!

The intention behind Bootbox is to create a maintainable set of the mentioned
items which can be reused across projects while still preserving the original
Bootstrap framework. This package treats Bootstrap as a peer-dependency and
has to be imported into a project already containing bootstrap.

Att Syntro, we use Bootbox to jumpstart new projects by removing the "base
bootstrap flair".

## How to use Bootbox
To install Bootbox we recommend using webpack as your bundler of choice.
